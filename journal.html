            <h1>My Ph.D. Journey Journal</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my journal. Here, I document my experiences, reflections, and milestones as a second-year Ph.D. student in Educational Psychology.</p>
            
            <!-- Example Journal Entry -->
            <article class="journal-entry">
                <h2>First Publication-2024/11/12</h2>
                <p> I’m thrilled to share that my submission has been accepted by the Journal of International Students! Every effort truly paid off, and I’m honored to have my work recognized in such a reputable journal.</p>
                <p>This milestone wouldn’t have been possible without the unwavering support of my advisor, Dr. Rebeca Mireles-Rios, whose guidance and encouragement have been invaluable. I also owe immense gratitude to my parents, whose constant support and belief in me, even from afar, kept me going through every challenge.</p>
                <p>I hope this publication contributes valuable insights to the field and inspires further exploration into the experiences of international students. This achievement motivates me to continue pushing forward in my research and exploring meaningful questions in educational psychology</p>
                <p>This publication marks an important milestone in my academic journey, and I’m eager to share these findings with a wider audience. </p>

                <h2>Flee maybe a good choice- 2024/11/1</h2>
                <p>These past few weeks have been overwhelming as I struggled with burnout from my TAship. This was my first time TAing for a course like ED191, which demands a highly interactive approach with students and relies heavily on memorization rather than slides. </p>
                <p>I wanted to do my best, but at times, I felt myself zoning out, unsure of what to say or how to engage students effectively. The constant pressure from the instructor only added to my stress.</p>
                
                <p>To add to the emotional weight, my roommate recently moved out after experiencing her own challenges with TAing, which led her to reconsider her fit for her program. This really made me think deeply about my own path and whether I should continue with this TAship. </p>
                <p>I decided to talk with my advisor, who offered me incredible support. Together, we decided that I would step back from this TA position for the next quarter.</p>
                
                <p>I hope this decision will help me find a sense of inner peace and give me the space to reconnect with my goals.</p>
                <p>I’m looking forward to taking this time to reset, refocus, and approach the next steps with a calm, grounded mindset</p>
                <p>Sometimes, stepping away isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s a choice to protect our mental health. Choosing not to persist with this TAship wasn’t about giving up—it was about recognizing my own limits and valuing my well-being. </p>
                <p>I’m learning that prioritizing mental health is just as important as any professional commitment. I hope this decision will help me find the inner peace I need to refocus and approach the future with renewed energy </p>
